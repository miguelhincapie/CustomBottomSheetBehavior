# CustomBottomSheetBehavior like Google Maps for Android
Android Studio Project using Support Library focused on get Google Maps 3 states behavior including background image parallax and toolbars animations.

## Example
[![CustomBottomSheetBehavior](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akan44/CustomBottomSheetBehavior/master/CustomBottomSheetBehaviorLikeGoogleMaps3states.gif)]

## What I did?
1. I took the code from BottomSheetBehavior.java from Support Library 23.4.0 and added one state for anchor mode, so now you have:<br>
STATE_HIDDEN<br>
STATE_COLLAPSED<br>
STATE_DRAGGING<br>
STATE_ANCHOR_POINT<br>
STATE_EXPANDED.<br><br>

2. Create Behaviors for FAB, ToolBars and ImageView.


## Motivation
Spend more than 3 days looking snipet of code or stackoverflow answers about it with no luck.

## Current state
